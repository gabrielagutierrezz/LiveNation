# Enhancing Live Nation Spain's Ticketing and Event Experience

This project aimed at addressing the operational challenges faced by Live Nation Spain in its ticketing and event experience, specifically the dependency on Ticketmaster Global for ticketing services. Live Nation, a company operating in concerts, ticketing, and sponsorship & advertising, has faced issues due to this reliance, notably during high-demand events where the Ticketmaster platform often becomes overloaded, leading to a suboptimal customer experience and lost revenue opportunities. Our objective was to devise a strategy that enables Live Nation Spain to gain independence in its ticketing process, thereby improving the customer experience, securing direct profits, and enhancing operational control. 
The comprehensive strategy we developed is aligned with business goals, emphasizing the integration of IT solutions that support strategic objectives and growth. We proposed leveraging cloud services to ensure scalability and reliability of the ticketing infrastructure, implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect customer data, and utilizing data analytics to gain insights into customer preferences for more personalized engagement. A key component of our strategy is the optimization of the mobile app and website to offer an intuitive and efficient user experience, ensuring ease of navigation and seamless ticket transactions. Additionally, we emphasized the importance of a clear IT management strategy to allocate and manage technology resources effectively. Looking towards future-proofing the ticketing system, we explored the transition to Web 3.0 technologies.
This strategy aims to transform Live Nation Spain's ticketing and event experience into a more autonomous, customer-centric, and efficient operation. The project received high commendations from our academic instructor for its strategic insight and potential to significantly impact Live Nation Spain's business operations, marking a step forward in redefining the live event ticketing landscape.
